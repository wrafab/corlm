<h1>Rotation 10: Raspberry Pi<h1>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1>Raspberry Pi was so much fun! Within the first day of using it we got to play Minecraft and other games that were programmed on.
<br>
<br>
I learned how to hook up the Raspberry Pi to the computer, plugging in the power source last. I also learned that while using the programs like Scratch or Python, on letter wrong or capitalized when it should not be can causes the entire circuit to fail.
<br>
<br>
Scratch and Python are important while using Raspberry Pi because they are the softwares that we use for programming circuits like pictures. These softwares use coding language to do so.
<br>
<br>
My favorite part of Raspberry Pi was using the camera and taking videos with Marcella. I also liked when we added specific coding onto Python to add a color filter over the picture that was taken.
<br>
<br>
Below are some picutres of the resulting circuit from our coding on Python.
