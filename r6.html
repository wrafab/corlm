<h1>1. Printing Stickers!
<br>
The first assignment of this rotataion was to make two stickers with the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1 in one color. The, using the  Roland 540i printer, we had to contour and cut colorful stickers. To design all the stickers, I used Corel Draw.
<br>
<br>
I printed two, one colored stickers and put them on my notebook. With the remaining sticker paper, I cut out a heart and M. Printing was a little difficult in making sure the printed cut the proper amount of times to cut the sticker, but not cut the paper.

<br>
Next, I printed out the colored stickers. This is when I used the contour tool on Corel Draw so that it would cut the sticker out in a circle. I was very excited when these printed out, especially because it was fast and easy.
