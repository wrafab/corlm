<h1>1. Printing Stickers!
<br>
The first assignment of this rotataion was to make two stickers with the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1 in one color. The, using the  Roland 540i printer, we had to contour and cut colorful stickers. To design all the stickers, I used Corel Draw.
<br>
<br>
I printed two, one colored stickers and put them on my notebook. With the remaining sticker paper, I cut out a heart and M. Printing was a little difficult because I had to make sure the printer cut the paper a proper amount of times to cut the design onto the sticker, but not cut the paper itself.

<br>
Next, I printed out the colored stickers. This is when I used the contour tool on Corel Draw so that it would cut the sticker out in a circle. I was very excited when these printed out, especially because it was fast and easy.

Creation of each sticker...
<br>
- I created all the stickers using Corel Draw and saved them as .eps
<br>
- Each sticker I made is related to me in some way or is something I like.
<br>
- The most challenging part was finding a picture that had minimum detail to print from the Roland GS-24 CAMM without any issues.
<br>
- I had never used these machines for printing stickers before, so that was something new that I learned.

Molding from a Negative
<br>
The next project we had was to use the MDX40A to subtrativley create a wax negative. Then, silicon was poured into the wax to create a mold. Then, we poured chocolate into the mold and made a candy out of our design.

Molding and Casting Pewter
<br>
The final project of this rotation was to create something using the laser cutter by cutting a design on a 3" by 3" wooden block. I used Corel Draw to insert a picture of a palm tree and subtracted it onto the wooden block. On a different wood block, I cut out a square that would outline the palm tree to make a square pewter block with a palm tree outline slighlty sticking out. The only issue while using the laser cutter was that in order to cut out thte square on the second wood block, it took several times before it fully cut through.
