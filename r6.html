<h1>1. Printing Stickers!
<br>
The first assignment of this rotataion was to make two stickers with the Roland GS-24 CAMM 1 in one color. The, using the  Roland 540i printer, we had to contour and cut colorful stickers. To design all the stickers, I used Corel Draw.
<br>
<br>
I printed two, one colored stickers and put them on my notebook. With the remaining sticker paper, I cut out a heart and M. Printing was a little difficult because I had to make sure the printedr cut the paper a proper amount of times to cut the design onto the sticker, but not cut the paper itself.

<br>
Next, I printed out the colored stickers. This is when I used the contour tool on Corel Draw so that it would cut the sticker out in a circle. I was very excited when these printed out, especially because it was fast and easy.

Creation of each sticker...
<br>
- I created all the stickers using Corel Draw and saved them as .eps
<br>
- Each sticker I made is related to me in some way or is something I like.
<br>
- The most challenging part was finding a picture that had minimum detail to print from the Roland GS-24 CAMM without any issues.
<br>
- I had never used these machines for printing stickers before, so that was something new that I learned.
