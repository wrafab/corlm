<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1> 1. What are the design rules and limitations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers?
<br>
	<br>
	Design Rules:
	<br>
	-You must use certain applications like Fusion360 to design the object you will be printing.
	<br>
	-After designing, you must export the file to MakerBot in order to print it.
<br>
<br>
	Limitations:
	<br>
	-Only print to the size of the 3D printer.
	<br>
	-Filament runs out over time.
	<br>
	-The base of the object has to be the size of the entire object.
	<br>
	-Objects such as trees must have supports all the way up when printed.
	<br>
	-The printer cannot capture small, intricate details.
<br>

2. Pedestal
<br>
The next thing I created was my head on a pedestal. First, I had someone else scan my face and put that file onto my computer as an STL. I edited my face on Meshmixer and then imported a pedestal into the file. Editing my face was hard because of all the different tools and their uses. I dragged my head onto the pedestal and exported it to Makerbot to 3D print!
