<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1> 1. What are the design rules and limitations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers?
<br>
	<br>
	Design Rules:
	<br>
	-You must use certain applications like Fusion360 to design the object you will be printing.
	<br>
	-After designing, you must export the file to MakerBot in order to print it.
<br>
<br>
	Limitations:
	<br>
	-Only print to the size of the 3D printer.
	<br>
	-Filament runs out over time.
	<br>
	-The base of the object has to be the size of the entire object.
	<br>
	-Objects such as trees must have supports all the way up when printed.
	<br>
	-The printer cannot capture small, intricate details.

2. Pedestal
<br>
The next thing I created was my head on a pedestal. First, I had someone else scan my face and put that file onto my computer as an STL. I edited my face on Meshmixer and then imported a pedestal into the file. Editing my face was hard because of all the different tools and their uses. I dragged my head onto the pedestal and exported it to Makerbot to 3D print! The final 3D print came out very well and the small details in my face are clear!

3. Design and print a 3D object that cannot be made subtractively
<br>
Using the Fusion360 program, I drew a square and extruded it to 2 inches. Then, I drew a cirlce on three sides and extruded them to hollow out the box, but at the same time keep the side structures so it would not fall apart. I put in on Makerbot and 3D printed it!

4. Useful 3D Print
<br>
Marcella and I decided to download and design a webcam cover for our computers. Using Thingiverse, we found a file of the cover and added design to make it our own unique print.
