<h1>Rotation 8: Soldering<h1>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1>At first, I thought soldering would not be very insteresting, but when I started doing it, I found it to be very fun and relaxing! The process of soldering is simple if you follow the instructions correct. However, if you make one mistake in the placetment of a piece, the overall circut would not work.
<br>
I soldered three different boards. The first had six lights that chased on another down a line. The second was a strobe light. And the last soldering porject was a sound of light, where when you clapped the light would turn on. The only one that did not work for me was the last one.
