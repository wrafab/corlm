<h1>Final Project: <h1>
<h1>1. For my final project, I decided to make a stand for jewelry. After contemplating different designs to hold the jewelry, I chose to 3D print my hand. Each finger would be able to hold a ring or whatever needed to be hung up.  
2. For the 3D model, I used a scanner to download an STL file onto my computer tha twould be of my hand. The scan cam out enough for me to be able to fix it in MeshMixer and smoothen it out. FInally, I dragged the final file onto Makerbot and 3D printed it. I also used the Laser Cutter to cut out a wooden box that the hand could stand on. I used Corel Draw to format the box so that it had notches to hold it together. I also hot glued the box together. To decorate the box, I printed out stickers of my inicials from the Roland sticker printer. I used Corel Draw to type the letters and put them on my box!
3. I have spent the past few classes working on my proejct to print it out. It took me two classes to figure out what exactly I wanted to do. I was able to print the box during one class and my hand and the stickers the next class. I assembled everything together after everything was printed out.
