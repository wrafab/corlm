<h1>Rotation 3: Design/Garment and Sublimation Printing<h1>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1>For Rotation 3, we got to design and print our own T-shirts! To design my T-shirt, I used photoshop. I have used photoshop before, so the tools were easy to find and use. My T-shirt is a picture of me kayaking in a waterfall of coffee, and it says "But first Coffee" since I love coffee. After finishing my design in photoshop, I used the program GT-3 to format the T-shirt to fit right when printed. To print, you must first put the shirt through the heat press to get out wrinkles. Then, use the Brother GT-3 printer to print your T-shirt! You have to be careful in placing the collar of the shirt below the metal bar on hte machine to make sure the immage you print is centered on the shirt properly. After the shirt is printed, you must put it back through the heat press in order for the ink to dry.

<h1>The next machine we used this roatation was the dye sublimation printer. To use this printer, you must save the file on Corel Draw with the right template for the item you are printing on. Then, you printer out your design on special paper, that when placed on your item and put through the heat press, the ink transfers over to your item. The reason why dye sublimation is better than the UV printer is because it directly transfers the design onto your item, making the image clear, unlike the UV printer that has to place ink for every pixel. The color of the dye sublimation printer is also very vibrant and does not fade after so long.
