<h1>Rotation 3: Design/Garment and Sublimation Printing<h1>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1>For rotation 2, we got to design and print our own T-shirts! To design my T-shirt, I used photoshop. I have used photoshop before, so the tools were easy to find and use. My T-shirt is a picture of me kayaking in a waterfall of coffee, and it says "But first Coffee" since I love coffee.
