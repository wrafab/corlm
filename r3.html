<h1>Rotation 3: Design/Garment and Sublimation Printing<h1>
<br>
<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<h1>For Rotation 3, we got to design and print our own T-shirts! To design my T-shirt, I used photoshop. I have used photoshop before, so the tools were easy to find and use. My T-shirt is a picture of me kayaking in a waterfall of coffee, and it says "But first Coffee" since I love coffee. After finishing my design in photoshop, I used the program GT-3 to format the T-shirt to fit right when printed. To print, you must first put the shirt through the heat press to get out wrinkles. Then, Use the Brother GT-3 printer to print your T-shirt! After the shirt is printed, you must put it back through the heat press in order for the ink to dry.
