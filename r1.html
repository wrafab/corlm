<h1> Project Description: <h1>
<br>
<h1> Our first project was to make a 3D design using Fusion 360 and Makerbot. I decided to make a stamp that when placed in wax would create a dolphin. Fusion 360 was not very new to me because I used programs similar to it in past years for 3D Art, so using the program was easy to get the hang of. My first design for my stamp was with a sphere as the top to hold onto. Then, to make the stamp easier to hold, I decided to make it of cylinders, but where you hold would have a smaller radius than where the stamp design would be. To make the design of the dolphin, I used the arc line and drew the various curves of the dolphin. I printed it through Makerbot to be 1 inch in size.
